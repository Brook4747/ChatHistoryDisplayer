# Chat History Displayer

## Shows the chat history and version controlled file submission.
### Supported by the Task View and Submission redesign team

We will be utilising a ruby [libray](https://github.com/ruby-git/ruby-git) to interface with git to display what files are new and what are already submitted for any given submission. 

We will create a working Proof of Concept (POC) in this repo before working on intergrating with the doubfire backend.
