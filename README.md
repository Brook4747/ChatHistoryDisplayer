# Chat History Displayer

## About

In T2/2022, the ChatHistoryDisplayer was created by former student Mat Perkins and supported by the
Task View and Submission Redesign team. The intention is to create an API that mediates various
functions similar to OnTrack/Doubtfire. It was originally devised as a proof-of-concept, and while
the concept is still being explored, it is possible that the API will come into it's own.

## Design as of T2/2022

### Documentational Artefact and Image Artefact

## Contributing

In T3/2022, the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) was created to instruct a person through getting
a development instance operational. Once operational, edits to the front-end and the back-end will
reflect after a simple browser refresh.
